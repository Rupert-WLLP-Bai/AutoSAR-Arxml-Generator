# Introduction 
ARXML Generator is a tool to generate ARXML files from given yaml and markdown files for AUTOSAR 4.2.2.

This tool can accelerate the development of AUTOSAR software components by generating ARXML files from yaml and markdown files. The yaml files are used to describe the AUTOSAR software components data types(data structures), and the markdown files are used to describe the AUTOSAR software components interfaces(client-server, sender-receiver). The ARXML files generated by this tool can be imported into AUTOSAR tools such as ETAS ISOLAR.
